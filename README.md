Hi everyone 👋🏻 I'm a software engineer—a creature that turns coffee into code. Debugging is part of my daily routine, deploying feels like defusing a bomb, and my weekends are usually spent in a toxic relationship with bugs. Some people hit the gym to relieve stress—I refactor code. After all, my muscles won't grow, but my code can look a whole lot better.

I speak more programming languages than I do in social settings, and most of my communication at work happens through Git commit messages. My goal is to write code that doesn’t need a README, and to come up with function names that still make sense to me three months later.
